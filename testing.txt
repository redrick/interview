For testing I'd use RSpec together with FactoryGirl and Capybara as a start.

If I had final screen mock-ups I'd start with integration tests
to simulate user interactions. Controller and unit tests
would be added as needed to cover all aspects (validations, business logic etc.)
of the growing application.
