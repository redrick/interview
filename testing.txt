I would use minitest for testing, with selenium for integration tests.

unit testing
- The most important would be to write unit tests for TaskForm class

functional testing
- test each endpoint -> both success and failures
- check for response codes
- check if authentication works (redirect to sign in page)
- check content of response

integration testing
- to check basic use cases(workflows).
