In the past I used RSpec and Capybara for testing, but now I would go
for Rails built-in testing. Examples:


To test validation, tasks must have name to be created

test "not to save task without name" do
    task = Task.new
    assert_not task.save
end


To test whether a category has been created by post request and user redirected to categories#index

test "to create category" do
  assert_difference('Category.count') do
    post :create, category: {name: 'Important'}
  end

  assert_redirected_to categories_path
end
