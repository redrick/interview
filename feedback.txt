Lack of:
  * i18n
  * pagination
  * delete task attachments
  * separation between administration environment and signed-in user todo list

I didn't understand why only Admin should be STI. Probably I misanderstood somthing, but to separate only Admin I presupposed that normal user are all Managers.

I didn't implement the drag and drop task at all because actually I don't know a fast way to do it and I was late on the other tasks.

Maybe, I didn't understand the task number 10 "use before filter to display number of undone tasks in layout".

The users list is not optimized. I added "number of tasks done over all" just for fun, but without pagination it would be very expensive in terms of database queries.
